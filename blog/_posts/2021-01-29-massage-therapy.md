Massage is perhaps one of the oldest healing traditions. Many ancient peoples, including the Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese and Indians, were convinced of the therapeutic properties of massage and used it to treat a variety of ailments.

Massage therapy is the practice of kneading or manipulating a person’s muscles and other soft-tissue in order to improve their well-being or health. It is a form of manual therapy that includes holding, moving, and applying pressure to the muscles, tendons, ligaments and fascia.

The term ‘massage therapy’ is used to describe a wide variety of techniques that vary in the manner in which touch, pressure, and the intensity of the treatment is applied. 

Massage can be effective in managing: 
- subacute/chronic low back pain
- delayed onset muscle soreness
- anxiety
- stress
- soft tissue injuries
- high blood pressure
- insomnia
