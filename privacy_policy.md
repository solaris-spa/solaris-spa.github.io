{{ site.organisation }} collects certain non-personally identify information about you when you visit our site. We may use this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group of users, not individuals.

# Our booking site will also ask you to provide personal information, but this feature is optional. If you share personal information with us, it will only be used in our internal booking system, not be shared with 3rd parties, and can be deleted on request.

We may also use cookies for site functionality, but you can choose not to store these.
